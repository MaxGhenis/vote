# Ventura County

California's 2022 primary election is on Tuesday, June 7.

## Federal office

### JULIA BROWNLEY for California's 26th Congressional District

Representative Julia Brownley is the only Democrat in the race.
The incumbent faces four competitors: three Republicans and one independent, Dave Goodman, who isn't a serious challenger.
Representative Brownley is a pretty standard Democrat; I've wished she would do more, like cosponsoring the [Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act](https://energyinnovationact.org), or at least holding back from supporting the regressive SALT deduction so strongly, but she's a reliable advocate of liberal issues in DC.

## California office

### STEVE BENNETT for California's 38th Assembly District

Assemblymember Steve Bennett is the only Democrat in the race.
The incumbent faces Republican Cole Brocato and Daniel Wilson, who isn't running with a party affiliation, but whose stances align with the Democratic Socialists of America.
Both Bennett and Wilson strongly urged Congress to enact a national carbon fee-and-dividend policy in the [Citizens' Climate Lobby questionnaire](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/be521693-9b01-41ad-ab11-6e8c538aff0f/page/1knwB?params=%7B%22df4%22:%22include%25EE%2580%25800%25EE%2580%2580IN%25EE%2580%2580California%2520Assembly%2520District%252038%22%7D) (Brocato didn't respond).
Assemblymember Bennett is an inconsistent supporter of housing---he abstained from SB9 and SB10 last year, but voted yes for AB1401--and in the [candidate forum](https://youtu.be/XtjTYaWkMdM) he minimized the need for more market-rate housing, but the others weren't any better.
Bennett is more knowledgeable and experienced, and less socialist, than Wilson.
Re-elect him.

## Ventura County office

### TBD for County Superintendent of Schools

Cesar Morales, the appointed incumbent, is the only candidate.
I will decide whether to cast the superfluous vote after reviewing his record.

### TBD for Assessor

### TBD for Auditor-Controller

### MICHELLE ASCENCION for County Clerk and Recorder

Michelle Ascension is the current Assistant County Clerk-Recorder and former City Clerk for Oxnard, and has the endorsement of the current Clerk-Recorder and most elected officials in the county.
The [candidate forum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVcvc1j7YSA) revealed that Ascension is the only candidate with relevant experience and knowledge to execute the duties of the office.
Jeff Hargleroad is a former show biz exec, and Bruce Boyer didn't join the forum.

As Ascencion stated in the forum, this is not a policymaking role, which means two things in my view:
1. It shouldn't be an elected office
2. If it is an elected office, voters should elect the most qualified candidate, as an elected body would ideally do when they appoint someone

Do what we should ask the Board of Supervisors or County CEO to do: put the person with the background to execute policy, Michelle Ascencion.

### ERIK NASARENKO for District Attorney

The Board of Supervisors unanimously appointed Erik Nasarenko as District Attorney, after experience on the Ventura City Council.
His [website](https://eriknasarenko.com/erik-on-the-issues/) indicates more thoughtfulness and compassion than that of his opponent, [John Barrick](https://barrick4da.com/).
Vote for a progressive DA, Erik Nasarenko.

### BILL AYUB for Sheriff

Bill Ayub is the incumbent, and his second-in-command, Jim Fryhoff, is running against him.
I watched their debate and read their websites, which suggested the main policy difference has to do with a pension reform Ayub was pushing, against the wishes of the deputy sheriff's union.
The union apparently then recruited and endorsed Fryhoff, along with a bunch of other law enforcement unions.
Don't let cop unions bully the public into paying for broken pension contracts.
Vote for Ayub.

### TBD for Treasurer-Tax Collector

### No on Measure A

### No on Measure B
