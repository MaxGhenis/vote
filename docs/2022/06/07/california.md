California's 2022 primary election is on Tuesday, June 7.

### MICHAEL SHELLENBERGER for Governor

Governor Newsom has disappointed me.
He's been lukewarm on housing bills that would achieve the ambitious goals he ran on, and his budget this year calls for an atrocious $11 billion in vehicle subsidies, between cutting the gas tax and per-vehicle payments.
Unfortunately, none of the 25 candidates 

The closest is [Michael Shellenberger](), who describes himself as a "Homelessness Policy Advocate" on the ballot, but who is probably best known as a nuclear energy advocate.
In the 2018 primary, [I would have voted for Shellenberger on the issues](https://maxghenis.medium.com/shellenberger-is-the-best-candidate-for-governor-but-villaraigosa-is-the-best-strategic-choice-for-d19cb4f205d5), but instead chose to vote strategically for the number-two-polling Democrat to ensure a Democrat won the general (it didn't work, but Newsom won handily anyway).
Back then, Shellenberger was the only candidate to support SB 827, the state bill that would legalize apartments near transit, and he was mostly a

### ELENI KOUNALAKIS for Lieutenant Governor

[I voted for now-Lieutenant Governor Kounalakis in the 2018 primary](), while suggesting that California join the seven other states without a Lieutenant Governor office.
Since her election, I haven't really heard anything noteworthy about her (again indicating that we'd be fine without the position), but now that she's running for re-election, she has no serious Democratic opponents.

### TBD for Secretary of State

### TBD for Controller

### TBD for Treasurer

### ROB BONTA for Attorney General

Since his appointment, Rob Bonta has used the powers of the office to address the housing crisis by taking action against cities that flaunt state housing law.
This has earned him [YIMBY Action's sole endorsement for statewide office this election](https://yimbyaction.org/endorsements/california/#statewide), and it should earn him your vote.

### TBD for Insurance Commissioner

### TBD for Board of Equalization, District 2

### TBD for Superintendent of Public Instruction
