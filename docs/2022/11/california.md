I referred to ballot measure texts, [Legislative Analyst Office analyses](https://lao.ca.gov/BallotAnalysis/Propositions?Length=14), and guides from [SPUR](https://www.spur.org/voter-guide/2022-11) and [GrowSF](https://growsf.org/voter-guide).

## Elected officials

These mostly follow my [votes in the June primary](2022/06/california.md).

### GAVIN NEWSOM for Governor

Newsom is running against Republican State Senator Brian Dahle.
As I wrote in my June guide, Newsom has generally disappointed me; however, he's recently signed critical housing bills AB 2011 (legalize housing on commercial sites) and AB 2097 (legalize parking-free buildings near transit).
He's far more liberal than his Republican challenger.

### ELENI KOUNALAKIS for Lieutenant Governor

No change since June primary.

### SHIRLEY WEBER for Secretary of State

No change since June primary.

### LANHEE CHEN for Controller

No change since June primary.

### FIONA MA for Treasurer

No change since June primary.

### ROB BONTA for Attorney General

No change since June primary, except that Bonta continues to rock it on enforcing state housing law against noncompliant local governments.

### RICARDO LARA for Insurance Commissioner

No change since June primary; the Republican challenger has no experience in politics or insurance.

### MICHELA ALIOTO-PIER for Board of Equalization, District 2

No change since June primary.

### TONY THURMOND for Superintendent of Public Instruction

No change since June primary.

## Ballot measures

### YES on Prop 1

*Remove California's viability standard for abortion and make it harder to restrict abortion in the future.*

In 2009, the California Legislature signed the [Reproductive Privacy Act](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2009/hsc/123460-123468.html#:~:text=The%20state%20may%20not%20deny,or%20health%20of%20the%20woman.) into law, which states:

> The state may not deny or interfere with a woman's right to choose or obtain an abortion prior to viability of the fetus, or when the abortion is necessary to protect the life or health of the woman.

[Prop 1 adds this language](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SCA10) to the California Constitution:

> The state shall not deny or interfere with an individual's reproductive freedom in their most intimate decisions, which includes their fundamental right to choose to have an abortion and their fundamental right to choose or refuse contraceptives. This section is intended to further the constitutional right to privacy guaranteed by Section 1, and the constitutional right to not be denied equal protection guaranteed by Section 7. Nothing herein narrows or Jimits the right to privacy or equal protection.

Prop 1 therefore makes two substantive changes:
1. Affirming the Reproductive Privacy Act in the California Constitution.
2. Omitting the Reproductive Privacy Act's "prior to viability of the fetus" clause; California abortion providers interpret the viability standard as 23 to 24 weeks of gestational age, and legal experts generally agree that this would strip the Reproductive Privacy Act of its viability standard if it were challenged in court.

Proponents emphasize the former change in the wake of Dobbs.
For instance, the [Yes on 1 campaign's fact sheet](https://www.protectabortionca.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/221010-YesOn1-FactSheet.pdf) states:

> Expressly stating a fundamental right to abortion in the state constitution will protect against potential future attacks at the federal level and from courts down the line.

Opponents emphasize the latter change.
For instance, the [No on Prop 1 website's](https://www.noproposition1.com/) tagline is:

> Prop 1 is too extreme. Late-term abortion without limit. At taxpayer expense.

Regarding the "taxpayer expense" concern, the [legislative analyst says](https://lao.ca.gov/BallotAnalysis/Proposition?number=1&year=2022):

> If a court finds that the proposition expands [abortion] rights, there could be fiscal effects to the state.

The Yes on 1 campaign generally doesn't mention the viability change, but on the second page of its [FAQ PDF file](https://www.protectabortionca.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/221010-YesOn1-FAQ.pdf), it states:

> The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists defines viability as a “...confluence of multiple complex factors, only one of which is gestational age. This complexity, which is different for each pregnancy, is best evaluated and managed within the context of a trusted relationship between a patient and their clinician. We all must work to combat misinformation and disinformation about reproductive health care. Statements about “abortion up until birth” are unscientific and crafted to polarize and politicize the conversation about abortion - an essential and incredibly common and safe medical procedure.”

The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists expands on this in its [abortion policy](https://www.acog.org/clinical-information/policy-and-position-statements/statements-of-policy/2022/abortion-policy) and [FAQ](https://www.acog.org/news/news-articles/2022/05/understanding-acog-policy-on-abortion), which states:

> ACOG strongly opposes any effort that impedes access to abortion care and interferes in the relationship between a person and their healthcare professional.

The American Medical Association also [states](https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/ethics/abortion):

> The Principles of Medical Ethics of the AMA do not prohibit a physician from performing an abortion in accordance with good medical practice and under circumstances that do not violate the law.

While Prop 1's constitutional nature makes it harder to restrict abortion in the future, I view its nullification of the viability standard as its most immediate and tangible policy impact.
So should abortions apply a viability standard?

I have always considered myself pro-choice, and I opposed the Dobbs ruling, but this question leaves me uncertain.

### YES on Prop 26

*Let Native American tribes offer sports betting.*

In 2018, the Supreme Court legalized sports betting.
24 states and DC have followed suit, but California has not.

Prop 26 legalizes sports betting and other games on tribal lands, and also legalizes sports betting on private horse-racing tracks in four counties.
It would levy a 10% tax on sports bets at horse-racing tracks; of this, 30% would fund specific programs in addiction, mental health, and enforcement, and the remaining 70% would go to the state general fund.

The [Legislative Analyst Office estimates](https://lao.ca.gov/BallotAnalysis/Proposition?number=26&year=2022) that Prop 26 will result in:

> Increased state revenues, possibly reaching tens of millions of dollars annually. Some of these revenues would support increased state regulatory and enforcement costs that could reach the low tens of millions of dollars annually.

Ideally, the Legislature would have acted by now---laws offer more flexibility than ballot measures---but four years is long enough to hope for successful negotiations.
California tribes deserve this economic opportunity, California sports enthusiasts deserve this freedom, and California residents deserve the programs this tax revenue would fund.

### YES on Prop 27

*Let Native American tribes and other entities offer sports betting.*

Prop 27 covers similar territory to Prop 26, though it allows online sports betting in more places and levies more fees and taxes.
Accordingly, [the Legislative Analyst Office estimates](https://lao.ca.gov/BallotAnalysis/Proposition?number=27&year=2022) that it would raise significantly more revenue than Prop 26:

> Increased state revenues, possibly in the hundreds of millions of dollars but not likely to exceed $500 million annually. Some revenues would support state regulatory costs, possibly reaching the mid-tens of millions of dollars annually.

85% of the revenues would fund state housing and mental health programs, and the remaining 15% would go to federally recognized tribes in California that do not offer online sports betting.

Props 26 and 27 compete, so if they both pass, the one with the most votes would take effect.
I prefer Prop 26's flexibility by directing revenues to the state general fund, but Prop 27's greater permissiveness and fees generate more economic activity and revenue for government services.
If I could rank them, I would favor Prop 27 over Prop 26, but either would improve upon the prohibitionist status quo, so I recommend voting yes on both.

### NO on Prop 28

*Don't divert funds from other priorities to arts education.*

Prop 28 requires the state to set aside [about \$1 billion per year](https://lao.ca.gov/BallotAnalysis/Proposition?number=28&year=2022) for arts education in government schools.
It doesn't raise any new revenue, so that money comes out of other state programs: healthcare, housing, other educational programs, and so on.
Passing Prop 28 would constrain the Legislature from budgeting in a way that meets the state's current needs.
Vote no.

### NO on Prop 29

*Don't require dialysis clinics to hire expensive doctors.*

Our absurd ritual continues: yet another election where labor unions waste voters' time with another dialysis ballot measure for leverage in contract negotiations.
As I've recommended in every such instance, vote no on this attempt at regulatory capture.

### NO on Prop 30

*Don't cut other programs for more vehicle subsidies.*

Prop 30 levies a new 1.75% tax on taxable incomes above \$2 million, with the revenue funding subsidies for zero-emissions vehicles (45%), charging stations (35%), and wildfire response and prevention (20%).

The new tax would raise the total marginal tax rate for Californians with income above \$2 million from 53.75% to 55.5%:
* 37% federal income tax
* 1.45% federal Medicare tax
* 0.9% federal additional Medicare tax
* 12.3% California income tax
* 1% California mental health services tax
* 1.1% California payroll tax
* **1.75% new California tax**

LAO: 3.5 billion to $5 billion annually
https://lao.ca.gov/BallotAnalysis/Proposition?number=30&year=2022

The Franchise Tax Board's [most recent Personal Income Tax report](https://data.ftb.ca.gov/California-Personal-Income-Tax/PIT-Annual-Report-2020/s2q7-rtsh) (for tax year 2019) summarizes tax returns by adjusted gross income bin.
While this will overstate the number of affected filers, since AGI exceeds taxable income, it would be roughly offset by income growth from 2019 to 2023, when the tax would begin.

The report shows that filers with AGI above $2 million:
* Count 35,000 (0.2% of all filers)
* Had \$220 billion in total taxable income
* Paid \$27 billion in state income tax, which was 30% of all state personal income income tax revenue

### NO on Prop 31

*Don't ban flavored tobacco products.*

In 2020, the Legislature passed [SB 793](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB793), which bans the sale of flavored tobacco products in California.
Prop 31 is a referendum on SB 793: if it passes, the ban is upheld; if it fails, the ban is overturned (this seems backwards to me but anyways).

https://lao.ca.gov/BallotAnalysis/Proposition?number=31&year=2022

> Decreased state tobacco tax revenues ranging from tens of millions of dollars annually to around $100 million annually.
