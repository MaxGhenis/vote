<h3>Scott Wiener for Senate District 11<a class="headerlink" href="#scott-wiener-for-senate-district-11" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I’m proud to have voted for Scott Wiener in my first San Francisco election in 2016.
As a result of his narrow win, the debate around housing policy has changed around the world;
I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say he’s had a greater impact on this policy area than anyone else in the country.</p>
<p>Wiener’s first major bill, SB 35, streamlined approvals of new housing projects in cities that failed to meet housing production targets.
This enabled developers to replace a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Senate_Bill_35_(2017)#Vallco_Mall_Project">mall in Cupertino</a> with 2,400 homes, overcoming the exclusionary city’s NIMBY leadership; it has also produced affordable housing in <a class="reference external" href="https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/20180407-san-francisco-chronicle-mission-housing-project-invokes-law-exchange-review-affordable">San Francisco</a> and other cities.</p>
<p>In 2018, Wiener pushed for SB 827, the most significant land use bill in California, attracting national media attention.
The bill would have legalized apartments in transit-rich areas, but it died in committee.
Wiener introduced its successor, SB 50, in 2019, expanding its scope to include job-rich areas and carving out vulnerable communities, and while it also failed to pass, it continued major momentum for pro-housing legislation, arguably creating room for less controversial bills like <a class="reference external" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB330">SB 330</a> to pass.</p>
<p>Wiener is a productive legislator who has worked hard on other issues as well.
He has passed multiple bills relating to <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Wiener#HIV_and_LGBT_issues_2">HIV and LGBT issues</a>, and has sought to increase state funding for bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure.</p>
<p>His opponent, Jackie Fielder, is aligned with the democratic-socialist wing of San Francisco politics.
She’s branding herself as the “progressive” in the race, but her policy stances reveal that she’s anything but. Fielder:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.sfexaminer.com/opinion/sb-50-authors-need-to-be-better-allies-of-tenants-low-income-people-and-people-of-color/">Opposes SB 50</a>, just as Wiener’s 2016 opponent <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/in-bid-for-west-side-support-jane-kim-announces-opposition-to-housing-density-bill/">opposed SB 827</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/JackieFielder_/status/1283489373292384259">Opposes Measure RR</a> to save Caltrain with a sales tax.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://jackieforsenate.com/transportation">Opposes gas taxes</a>, critical for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/JackieFielder_/status/1304569710256693248">Opposes California’s carbon pricing system</a>, which has <a class="reference external" href="https://www.c2es.org/content/california-cap-and-trade/">reduced emissions</a> and raised billions to fight climate change and help low-income communities.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn’t matter how progressive the effects of a policy are, if it involves markets, Fielder opposes it.
Her <a class="reference external" href="https://jackieforsenate.com/issues/housing">housing plan</a> condemns market-rate housing, instead seeking to print $100 billion to add 100,000 homes over a decade.
This is both wildly unrealistic—California’s General Fund is only <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebudget.ca.gov/budget/2020-21/#/Home">$150 billion</a>—and wildly insufficient—California is short <a class="reference external" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Public%20and%20Social%20Sector/Our%20Insights/Closing%20Californias%20housing%20gap/Closing-Californias-housing-gap-In-Brief.pdf">3.5 million homes</a>, which will require at least a trillion dollars of investment to build.
Apartment legalization would help either way, but because it allows some of those apartments be market-rate (the kind of homes the vast majority of Californians live in), she’ll side with wealthy NIMBYs, conservatives, and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.capradio.org/articles/2020/08/17/politifact-california-trump-claims-california-lawmaker-pushed-to-abolish-single-family-zoning-is-he-right/">Donald Trump</a> in opposing it.</p>
<p>However Fielder describes herself, the result of her policy preferences would be higher housing costs, more carbon emissions, and more poverty.
Between her and the most effective, progressive pro-housing legislator in the country, the choice is clear.</p>

<h3>David Chiu for Assembly District 17<a class="headerlink" href="#david-chiu-for-assembly-district-17" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://votedavidchiu.com">Chiu</a> is a major ally to YIMBYs, both in substance, for example authoring <a class="reference external" href="https://a17.asmdc.org/press-releases/bill-increase-transit-oriented-development-bart-stations-signed-governor">AB 2923</a> which allows BART to build more housing on its land, and sentiment, having spoken at many YIMBY events.
He is a reliable vote for pro-housing legislation, such as SB 50 and SB 330.
The anti-housing views of his <a class="reference external" href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2015/10/27/sf-supervisor-campos-rallies-for-development-moratorium-in-mission-district/">opponent</a> in the close 2014 race that brought Chiu to the assembly, demonstrates his “value above replacement” to AD-17.</p>
<p>Chiu has also authored bills to expand Medicaid, fund transit, and pursue other progressive priorities.</p>
<p>His record isn’t perfect, as he’s also been the chief advocate of rent control—which benefits incumbents at the cost of newcomers—in Sacramento, authoring AB 1482, signed in 2019.
He’s also authored AB 857, which enables cities to create “public banks,” a performative institution that advocates falsely claim will enable them to essentially print money for government projects, avoiding real solutions like taxes and permitting the market to deliver critical services like housing.</p>
<p>Chiu’s opponent, <a class="reference external" href="http://starchild.forliberty.org/">Starchild</a> received <a class="reference external" href="https://ballotpedia.org/David_Chiu_(California)">56 write-in votes</a> in the primary, and while he has progressive values on zoning, sex work, and immigration, he has no public policy experience and advocates counterproductive policies like abolishing the police and reducing lawmaker compensation.</p>

<div class="section" id="phil-ting-for-assembly-district-19">
<h3>Phil Ting for Assembly District 19<a class="headerlink" href="#phil-ting-for-assembly-district-19" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.philting.com/">Ting</a> focuses less on housing than his peers Chiu and Wiener, but he still votes reliably for pro-housing legislation.
As chair of the Assembly Budget committee, he has notably promoted the <a class="reference external" href="https://a19.asmdc.org/californias-earned-income-tax-credit">expansion of CalEITC</a>, a cash transfer to low-income Californians.
CalEITC <a class="reference external" href="https://calbudgetcenter.org/resources/expanding-the-caleitc-a-smart-investment-to-broaden-economic-security-in-california/">effectively reduces poverty</a> in California and is a step toward basic income.</p>
<p>His opponent, <a class="reference external" href="http://johnmcdonnellforassembly.com/">John McDonnell</a>, is a Republican who demonizes people experiencing homelessness and the gas tax, and advocates protecting Prop 13’s inequitable property tax system.
While I agree with him on some views like equal protection, allowing gig work, and supporting charter schools, a vote for any Republican is, today and for years to come, a vote for Trumpism and the GOP, which have failed our country and our state.</p>

<h3>Danny Sauter for District 3 Supervisor<a class="headerlink" href="#danny-sauter-for-district-3-supervisor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.dannyd3.com/">Sauter</a> seeks to provide District 3 with new leadership.
It is desperately needed.</p>
<p>Incumbent Aaron Peskin has, since being first elected in 2000, authored and supported <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Peskin#Housing_and_development">legislation</a> that has plunged San Francisco into its housing crisis.
He’s tried to block allowing housing at a hotel site and on Treasure Island.
When not outright opposing housing projects, he has promoted tools like CEQA and historic preservation to de facto reduce the number of homes.
He introduced <a class="reference external" href="https://www.aaronpeskin2020.com/biography">legislation</a> that raises the share of housing units developers must reserve for low- and middle-income tenants to 32 percent; similar legislation <a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/yimby/the-25-inclusionary-rate-is-killing-affordable-housing-db143c4abd31">cratered development</a>.
And he’s led <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sfweekly.com/news/s-f-supervisors-call-for-amendments-to-sb-827/">city resolutions</a> to formally oppose state laws like SB 827 to legalize apartments.</p>
<p>Peskin’s bad policy extends beyond housing.
He’s proposed <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/SF-s-proposed-employee-cafeteria-ban-not-to-13121402.php">banning employee cafeterias</a> that create jobs for food workers, and wants to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2020/02/20/two-takes-on-the-vacancy-tax-ballot-measure.html">tax vacant storefronts</a>, even if they’re waiting on permits.
He <a class="reference external" href="https://icosahedron-megalodon-8y6y.squarespace.com/results-page/#environmental">capped permits</a> for alternative mobility options like bikeshare and scooters that reduce vehicle reliance.
During the pandemic, he’s enacted price controls on delivery companies and opposed the initial version of Measure RR to fund Caltrain with a sales tax.</p>
<p>Finally, Peskin is personally unfit to serve the people of San Francisco.
He has performed his duties while <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/SF-firefighters-say-Supervisor-Peskin-12803523.php">intoxicated</a>, and is known for harassment.
He <a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/&#64;vwoo/the-hypocrisy-of-aaron-peskin-177a8a739423">illegally converted</a> a rent-controlled duplex into a single home, abusing his power, and then proposed legislation to slow even minor modifications to similar projects.</p>
<p>Sauter could not be more different.
On <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dannyd3.com/housing">housing</a>, he wants to “legalize apartment buildings,” “reform discretionary review,”
“prioritize transit-oriented development,” and, for the first time in almost two decades, “set a goal and strategy for District 3 housing.”
On <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dannyd3.com/transit">transportation</a>, he wants to make it safer for pedestrians and bicyclists to get around, and improve transit.
He’s the respectful, thoughtful, policy-oriented leader District 3 deserves.</p>

<p>Prop A is a bond for homelessness, parks, street and sidewalk safety.</p>
<p>Local bonds are a great way to fund priorities since they can raise property taxes beyond the far-too-law rate of one percent dictated by 1978 Prop 13.
Because property values in San Francisco are primarily land values, property taxes function nearly as land value taxes, which are one of the most efficient forms of taxation.

While <a class="reference external" href="https://maxghenis.medium.com/no-on-san-francisco-proposition-c-a8b4710a45b0">2018 Prop C</a> created the largest budget set-aside in history, locking in nearly $700 million per year to homelessness in perpetuity, there are probably some valuable uses of marginal dollars for homelessness;
if nothing else, SF could give homeless people money, as an organization in Canada recently piloted, with <a class="reference external" href="https://forsocialchange.org/new-leaf-project-overview">positive results</a>.
San Francisco is sorely lacking in parks, and street and sidewalk safety have much room for improvement.

<p>The Controller’s report also estimated that, beginning in 2023 due to the elimination of the payroll tax,
“An increase in employment in the City, and in City contractors, would slightly outweigh the job losses in the industries that face tax increases under the proposal.”</p>
<p>The tax revenue and slight employment growth are not the only effects of the measure, though.
Prop F doubles down on a gross receipts tax, which doesn’t exempt wages, expenses, or investments like corporate income taxes do
Nor do gross receipts taxes limit their scope to consumption, like both retail sales taxes (which tax final products) and value added taxes (VATs, which tax throughout the chain, and exist in all developed countries except the US) do.
Instead, they tax a share of a firm’s global gross receipts (revenues) attributable to San Francisco operations, with <a class="reference external" href="https://sftreasurer.org/business/taxes-fees/gross-receipts-tax-gr">rates and attribution rules</a> varying by industry and gross receipts.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://search.proquest.com/docview/203281374?fromopenview=true&amp;pq-origsite=gscholar">Experts agree</a> that gross receipts taxes are extremely inefficient and distortionary.
Taxing each level of production, called <a class="reference external" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=963557">tax pyramiding</a>,
encourages vertical integration.
Ignoring expenses like payroll and inputs discourages growth and investment.
Basing tax rates on industry attracts corruption, with huge payoffs for favorable classification.</p>
<p>Prop F also increases the extent to which taxes rise with employer size.
While progressive taxation might make sense for individuals, the same logic doesn’t hold for firms: policy should not discourage growth and hiring.
But by shifting more to the gross receipts tax—which has graduated scales such that largest businesses often pay double the rate of smaller ones–and exempting small businesses from more taxes, that’s exactly what Prop F does.</p>
<p>To illustrate these distortions, consider a small business that provides administrative services for retailers, while also having a demo retail shop of its own (similarly to <a class="reference external" href="https://sf.eater.com/2019/7/23/20706270/eatsa-closed-tech-company-starbucks-investment-brightloom">Eatsa</a> for food).
Here are a few wasteful things a gross receipts tax would encourage them to do:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Lobby tax authorities to classify them as being in the retail industry,</strong> where they’ll pay a <em>seventh</em> of the taxes they’d pay if they’re instead classified as in the administrative services industry.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Shift business practices from administrative services to retail</strong> if their lobbying fails, so that the tax authorities reclassify them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Merge with another retail business</strong>, or acquire or be acquired by one, to raise their chances of being classified as retail.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Split their retail business from their services business</strong> if neither of the above practices convince tax authorities, since at least their retail business could lower its taxes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Avoid hiring people</strong> which could push them into a higher tax bracket, either through increased payroll or increased sales.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expand operations outside of San Francisco</strong> to reduce the share of payroll or sales in San Francisco, which determines their tax base conditional on global gross receipts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Split business</strong> to stay in a lower tax bracket and qualify for other small business tax breaks in Prop F.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If lawmakers want comprehensive tax reform, they should go back to the drawing board to identify a reform that doesn’t repeal the tried-and-true payroll tax in lieu of the most distortionary tax available.
They could abandon the gross receipts tax and return to the fair and simple payroll tax it replaced in 2012.
They could raise retail sales tax rates.
They could enact a VAT, which enables other developed countries to fund their generous social services.
They could offset potential distributional drawbacks (which haven’t been identified or quantified) with transfers to low-income San Franciscans.</p>
<p>Prop F barely raises any new revenue before the 2022 election, and after that it grows the General Fund by about 1.5 percent.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#sf-general-fund" id="id2">2</a>
Rejecting this flawed proposal now creates an opportunity for leaders to bring the voters something better thought through in the future, without cementing a terrible fiscal precedent.</p>

</ul>
<p>A less robust part of their analysis also found that it would have raised revenues by an average of $196 million per year (about 3 percent of the General Fund<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#sf-general-fund" id="id3">2</a>) over the past three years.
However, this does not consider the effects on deferring sales to avoid triggering the tax, and the economist cautions that actual future revenues would be less.</p>
<p>This measure taxes specifically what San Francisco needs more of: large multifamily housing and dense commercial space.
It puts more wood behind a broken arrow, with the transfer tax discouraging the turnover in properties that loosens San Francisco’s tight housing market, and also creating huge cliffs at particular sale prices by virtue of not being a marginal tax.
Transfer taxes should cover the cost of the city processing the transfer, and no more.</p>
<p>By funding specific programs, it also reduces elected officials’ power over budgeting.
And these specific programs are particularly flawed.
Reimbursing waived rent will accrue disproportionately to landlords and tenants in expensive properties, who will be disproportionately rich.
It also fails to target people in need, targeting instead those who know new laws well enough to find how to get rent waived.
Public housing is allocated by lottery, forcing low-income people into whichever home they happen to be selected for, rather than empowering them to choose where to live.
San Francisco also has programs to help low-income people in more direct and freeing ways, such as the Working Families Credit.</p>
<p>Prop I is a misleading measure that discourages density, harms the economy, and directs resources to flawed programs.</p>

<h3>Yes on Prop J<a class="headerlink" href="#yes-on-prop-j" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Prop J replaces a 2018 parcel tax currently facing legal battles with a new one that would fund schools.
Parcel taxes are great because land in San Francisco has appreciated so rapidly, making landowners generally quite wealthy.
Normally, that kind of public wealth could be captured by property taxes—or better yet, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax">land values taxes</a>—but since Prop 13 limits that, parcel taxes approximate it while also taxing multifamily housing less than single-family homes (since each building, rather than unit, is treated as a single parcel).
Funding schools, which need resources to educate kids in new Covid-19 circumstances, is a worthy use.</p>

<h3>No on Prop K<a class="headerlink" href="#no-on-prop-k" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Prop K allows the city to build public housing.</p>
<p>Public housing is one of the worst ways to spend public funds.
Since it is always oversubscribed, it’s allocated by lottery, leaving people on waitlists for years or decades.
People who want to be considered often have to apply for each new opening, getting their hopes up for almost-certain repeated rejection.
There’s also evidence that public housing <a class="reference external" href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/denmark-ghettos-public-housing/">generates anti-immigrant sentiment</a>, since it’s such a visceral, tangible zero-sum assistance policy.</p>
<p>Since Prop K doesn’t raise any revenue, it takes money away from better policies.
For example, for the $500,000 or so it would cost to build a single public housing unit, San Francisco could expand its <a class="reference external" href="https://reason.com/2020/10/13/san-francisco-will-pay-artists-1000-a-month-in-universal-basic-income/">basic income pilot</a> to an additional 100 artists.
For the cost of four units, it could reopen its <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18RpLUx_Bz6bCC2gucEq8YUobfg_g8baVHDYovfJNK7w/edit">Working Families Credit</a>, a cash transfer for low-income San Franciscans, to all 8,000 families who qualify, not just those who haven’t claimed it in prior years.
For the $5 billion it would cost to meet author Dean Preston’s goal of 10,000 public housing units, it could become the first jurisdiction in the continental US to offer a child allowance, giving $300 per month for each child in the city for more than a decade.
These broad-based transfers don’t rely on lotteries or waiting for approval and hodgepodges of funds, they simply reduce poverty and inequality in an empowering way.</p>
<p>Reject Prop K to force city officials to invest government resources in more productive ways.</p>

<div class="section" id="no-on-prop-l">
<h3>No on Prop L<a class="headerlink" href="#no-on-prop-l" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Prop L would assess additional gross receipts taxes to firms whose top-paid employee is paid at least 100 times the median San Francisco employee.
The additional rate rises with the rate, with the top rate kicking in at a ratio of 600:1.
For firms with only <a class="reference external" href="https://sftreasurer.org/business/taxes-fees/administrative-office-tax-aot">administrative offices</a> in San Francisco—offices defined by the treasurer as those without “sales personnel or personnel actively engaged in marketing, research and development, direct customer service, and product support services”—the new tax is assessed on payroll rather than gross receipts.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://sfcontroller.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Economic%20Analysis/200629_economic%20impact_final.pdf">city economist’s report</a> found that the tax would have the following effects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Add $60 million to $140 million in annual tax revenue (1-2 percent of the General Fund)</p></li>
<li><p>Lose the city 615 employees (0.06 percent), most significantly in retail trade, financial services, and accommodations</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce GDP by $60 million (0.03 percent)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While it’s temperamentally targeted toward tech companies, the retail trade sector would be the most disproportionately impacted, paying 23 percent of the tax while making up 7 percent of current employment.</p>

<h3>Yes on Measure RR<a class="headerlink" href="#yes-on-measure-rr" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Measure RR is a sales tax to fund Caltrain.
Without it, Caltrain risks shutdowns.
Rail transit is critical for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, and provides affordable transportation options for people who don’t want to incur the large expenses of vehicle ownership.
Sales taxes avoid distortions of some of the other more convoluted taxes on the San Francisco ballot, and the progressive benefits of public transit far outweights its mild regressivity.</p>
