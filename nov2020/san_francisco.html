<h3>Scott Wiener for Senate District 11<a class="headerlink" href="#scott-wiener-for-senate-district-11" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>Iâm proud to have voted for Scott Wiener in my first San Francisco election in 2016.
As a result of his narrow win, the debate around housing policy has changed around the world;
I donât think itâs an exaggeration to say heâs had a greater impact on this policy area than anyone else in the country.</p>
<p>Wienerâs first major bill, SB 35, streamlined approvals of new housing projects in cities that failed to meet housing production targets.
This enabled developers to replace a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Senate_Bill_35_(2017)#Vallco_Mall_Project">mall in Cupertino</a> with 2,400 homes, overcoming the exclusionary cityâs NIMBY leadership; it has also produced affordable housing in <a class="reference external" href="https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/20180407-san-francisco-chronicle-mission-housing-project-invokes-law-exchange-review-affordable">San Francisco</a> and other cities.</p>
<p>In 2018, Wiener pushed for SB 827, the most significant land use bill in California, attracting national media attention.
The bill would have legalized apartments in transit-rich areas, but it died in committee.
Wiener introduced its successor, SB 50, in 2019, expanding its scope to include job-rich areas and carving out vulnerable communities, and while it also failed to pass, it continued major momentum for pro-housing legislation, arguably creating room for less controversial bills like <a class="reference external" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB330">SB 330</a> to pass.</p>
<p>Wiener is a productive legislator who has worked hard on other issues as well.
He has passed multiple bills relating to <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Wiener#HIV_and_LGBT_issues_2">HIV and LGBT issues</a>, and has sought to increase state funding for bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure.</p>
<p>His opponent, Jackie Fielder, is aligned with the democratic-socialist wing of San Francisco politics.
Sheâs branding herself as the âprogressiveâ in the race, but her policy stances reveal that sheâs anything but. Fielder:</p>
<ul class="simple">

<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/JackieFielder_/status/1283489373292384259">Opposes Measure RR</a> to save Caltrain with a sales tax.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://jackieforsenate.com/transportation">Opposes gas taxes</a>, critical for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/JackieFielder_/status/1304569710256693248">Opposes Californiaâs carbon pricing system</a>, which has <a class="reference external" href="https://www.c2es.org/content/california-cap-and-trade/">reduced emissions</a> and raised billions to fight climate change and help low-income communities.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It doesnât matter how progressive the effects of a policy are, if it involves markets, Fielder opposes it.
Her <a class="reference external" href="https://jackieforsenate.com/issues/housing">housing plan</a> condemns market-rate housing, instead seeking to print $100 billion to add 100,000 homes over a decade.
This is both wildly unrealisticâCaliforniaâs General Fund is only <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ebudget.ca.gov/budget/2020-21/#/Home">$150 billion</a>âand wildly insufficientâCalifornia is short <a class="reference external" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Public%20and%20Social%20Sector/Our%20Insights/Closing%20Californias%20housing%20gap/Closing-Californias-housing-gap-In-Brief.pdf">3.5 million homes</a>, which will require at least a trillion dollars of investment to build.
Apartment legalization would help either way, but because it allows some of those apartments be market-rate (the kind of homes the vast majority of Californians live in), sheâll side with wealthy NIMBYs, conservatives, and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.capradio.org/articles/2020/08/17/politifact-california-trump-claims-california-lawmaker-pushed-to-abolish-single-family-zoning-is-he-right/">Donald Trump</a> in opposing it.</p>
<p>However Fielder describes herself, the result of her policy preferences would be higher housing costs, more carbon emissions, and more poverty.
Between her and the most effective, progressive pro-housing legislator in the country, the choice is clear.</p>

Finally, Prop F contains elements pertaining to prior ballot measures, which a <a class="reference external" href="https://missionlocal.org/2020/09/prop-c-supreme-court/">court decision</a> has made irrelevant.</p>
<p>A <a class="reference external" href="https://sfcontroller.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Economic%20Analysis/200648_economic%20impact_final.pdf">report</a> from the Controllerâs office, which considers Covid-19, found that Prop F would have modest revenue effects over the next couple years, followed by steady revenue increases of about $100 million per year beginning in 2024.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#prop-f-revenue" id="id1">1</a></p>

<p>The Controllerâs report also estimated that, beginning in 2023 due to the elimination of the payroll tax,
âAn increase in employment in the City, and in City contractors, would slightly outweigh the job losses in the industries that face tax increases under the proposal.â</p>
<p>The tax revenue and slight employment growth are not the only effects of the measure, though.
Prop F doubles down on a gross receipts tax, which doesnât exempt wages, expenses, or investments like corporate income taxes do
Nor do gross receipts taxes limit their scope to consumption, like both retail sales taxes (which tax final products) and value added taxes (VATs, which tax throughout the chain, and exist in all developed countries except the US) do.
Instead, they tax a share of a firmâs global gross receipts (revenues) attributable to San Francisco operations, with <a class="reference external" href="https://sftreasurer.org/business/taxes-fees/gross-receipts-tax-gr">rates and attribution rules</a> varying by industry and gross receipts.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://search.proquest.com/docview/203281374?fromopenview=true&amp;pq-origsite=gscholar">Experts agree</a> that gross receipts taxes are extremely inefficient and distortionary.
Taxing each level of production, called <a class="reference external" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=963557">tax pyramiding</a>,
encourages vertical integration.
Ignoring expenses like payroll and inputs discourages growth and investment.
Basing tax rates on industry attracts corruption, with huge payoffs for favorable classification.</p>
<p>Prop F also increases the extent to which taxes rise with employer size.
While progressive taxation might make sense for individuals, the same logic doesnât hold for firms: policy should not discourage growth and hiring.
But by shifting more to the gross receipts taxâwhich has graduated scales such that largest businesses often pay double the rate of smaller onesâand exempting small businesses from more taxes, thatâs exactly what Prop F does.</p>
<p>To illustrate these distortions, consider a small business that provides administrative services for retailers, while also having a demo retail shop of its own (similarly to <a class="reference external" href="https://sf.eater.com/2019/7/23/20706270/eatsa-closed-tech-company-starbucks-investment-brightloom">Eatsa</a> for food).
Here are a few wasteful things a gross receipts tax would encourage them to do:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Lobby tax authorities to classify them as being in the retail industry,</strong> where theyâll pay a <em>seventh</em> of the taxes theyâd pay if theyâre instead classified as in the administrative services industry.</p></li>

<p>If lawmakers want comprehensive tax reform, they should go back to the drawing board to identify a reform that doesnât repeal the tried-and-true payroll tax in lieu of the most distortionary tax available.
They could abandon the gross receipts tax and return to the fair and simple payroll tax it replaced in 2012.
They could raise retail sales tax rates.
They could enact a VAT, which enables other developed countries to fund their generous social services.
They could offset potential distributional drawbacks (which havenât been identified or quantified) with transfers to low-income San Franciscans.</p>
<p>Prop F barely raises any new revenue before the 2022 election, and after that it grows the General Fund by about 1.5 percent.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#sf-general-fund" id="id2">2</a>
Rejecting this flawed proposal now creates an opportunity for leaders to bring the voters something better thought through in the future, without cementing a terrible fiscal precedent.</p>

<h3>Yes on Prop G<a class="headerlink" href="#yes-on-prop-g" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>Prop G allows 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in local elections.
Young people are increasingly active in, and knowledgeable about, politics.
Giving them a formal voice while still at home with parents could raise turnout later in lifeâyoung adult turnout is <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/upshot/youth-voting-2020-election.html">notoriously low</a>.</p>

<h3>Yes on Prop H<a class="headerlink" href="#yes-on-prop-h" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>Prop H removes a number of unnecessary and counterproductive roadblocks to starting and operating a business.
For example, it streamlines the process for public engagement, which has added months to activities as minor as <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/heatherknight/article/Bid-to-open-S-F-ice-cream-shop-turns-into-a-15614815.php">opening an ice cream shop</a>.
It also legalizes the cafe/workspace model in certain districts, allows restaurant service in parklets (as the city has temporarily allowed for public health reasons), and makes other changes to help businesses commence and modify their activities without permission from City Hall and neighbors.</p>
<p>Ideally, this would be passed as legislation, but the Board of Supervisors has <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/S-F-small-businesses-are-struggling-Here-s-15626450.php">failed to act</a>, so Mayor Breed brought the choice to voters.</p>
<p>As San Francisco recovers from Covid-19âs economic collapse, its failed limitations will become a bigger drag than theyâve already been.
Prop H fixes issues that have long plagued the city, at a time when it especially needs them to be fixed.</p>

<h3>No on Prop I<a class="headerlink" href="#no-on-prop-i" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>Prop I doubles taxes on sales of properties valued at $10 million or more, with revenues compensating landlords who waive rent payments due to Covid-19 and funding public housing projects.
This has been sold as a tax on âmansions,â but in reality, its targets are new apartment buildings and large commercial buildings, which are transferred from the developer to property managers.
The city economist projects <a class="reference external" href="https://sfcontroller.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Economic%20Analysis/200654_economic%20impact_final.pdf">major negative impacts</a> due to discouraging construction:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>450 housing units lost per year (0.1 percent), raising housing prices by 0.17 percent</p></li>
<li><p>210,000 square feet of commercial space lost per year (0.2 percent), raising non-residential prices by 0.31 percent</p></li>
<li><p>625 jobs lost (0.06 percent)</p></li>
<li><p>$50 million of GDP lost (0.03 percent)</p></li>
<li><p>$100 lower per-capita disposable income by 2030</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A less robust part of their analysis also found that it would have raised revenues by an average of $196 million per year (about 3 percent of the General Fund<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#sf-general-fund" id="id3">2</a>) over the past three years.
However, this does not consider the effects on deferring sales to avoid triggering the tax, and the economist cautions that actual future revenues would be less.</p>
<p>This measure taxes specifically what San Francisco needs more of: large multifamily housing and dense commercial space.
It puts more wood behind a broken arrow, with the transfer tax discouraging the turnover in properties that loosens San Franciscoâs tight housing market, and also creating huge cliffs at particular sale prices by virtue of not being a marginal tax.
Transfer taxes should cover the cost of the city processing the transfer, and no more.</p>
<p>By funding specific programs, it also reduces elected officialsâ power over budgeting.
And these specific programs are particularly flawed.
Reimbursing waived rent will accrue disproportionately to landlords and tenants in expensive properties, who will be disproportionately rich.
It also fails to target people in need, targeting instead those who know new laws well enough to find how to get rent waived.
Public housing is allocated by lottery, forcing low-income people into whichever home they happen to be selected for, rather than empowering them to choose where to live.
San Francisco also has programs to help low-income people in more direct and freeing ways, such as the Working Families Credit.</p>
<p>Prop I is a misleading measure that discourages density, harms the economy, and directs resources to flawed programs.</p>

<h3>Yes on Prop J<a class="headerlink" href="#yes-on-prop-j" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>Prop J replaces a 2018 parcel tax currently facing legal battles with a new one that would fund schools.
Parcel taxes are great because land in San Francisco has appreciated so rapidly, making landowners generally quite wealthy.
Normally, that kind of public wealth could be captured by property taxesâor better yet, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax">land values taxes</a>âbut since Prop 13 limits that, parcel taxes approximate it while also taxing multifamily housing less than single-family homes (since each building, rather than unit, is treated as a single parcel).
Funding schools, which need resources to educate kids in new Covid-19 circumstances, is a worthy use.</p>

<h3>No on Prop L<a class="headerlink" href="#no-on-prop-l" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>Prop L would assess additional gross receipts taxes to firms whose top-paid employee is paid at least 100 times the median San Francisco employee.
The additional rate rises with the rate, with the top rate kicking in at a ratio of 600:1.
For firms with only <a class="reference external" href="https://sftreasurer.org/business/taxes-fees/administrative-office-tax-aot">administrative offices</a> in San Franciscoâoffices defined by the treasurer as those without âsales personnel or personnel actively engaged in marketing, research and development, direct customer service, and product support servicesââthe new tax is assessed on payroll rather than gross receipts.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://sfcontroller.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Economic%20Analysis/200629_economic%20impact_final.pdf">city economistâs report</a> found that the tax would have the following effects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Add $60 million to $140 million in annual tax revenue (1-2 percent of the General Fund)</p></li>
<li><p>Lose the city 615 employees (0.06 percent), most significantly in retail trade, financial services, and accommodations</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce GDP by $60 million (0.03 percent)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While itâs temperamentally targeted toward tech companies, the retail trade sector would be the most disproportionately impacted, paying 23 percent of the tax while making up 7 percent of current employment.</p>

<h3>Yes on Measure RR<a class="headerlink" href="#yes-on-measure-rr" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>Measure RR is a sales tax to fund Caltrain.
Without it, Caltrain risks shutdowns.
Rail transit is critical for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, and provides affordable transportation options for people who donât want to incur the large expenses of vehicle ownership.
Sales taxes avoid distortions of some of the other more convoluted taxes on the San Francisco ballot, and the progressive benefits of public transit far outweights its mild regressivity.</p>
