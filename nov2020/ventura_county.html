<p>Oxnard Mayor Pro Tem <a class="reference external" href="https://carmen4supervisor.com/">Carmen Ramirez</a> and
Oxnard Mayor <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tim4supervisor.com/">Tim Flynn</a> are running for the county supervisor seat
vacated by John Zaragoza, who’s termed out and running for Oxnard Mayor (<span class="xref myst">I’m voting for him</span>).
Ramirez is simply the more pro-housing choice.
She <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/MaxGhenis/status/1197031504490057729">advocated forcefully</a> for a homeless shelter.
She supported compliance with a state accessory dwelling unit law, which Flynn wrongly claimed would

While both Ramirez and Flynn voted against the <a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/vcyimby/support-for-oxnard-fishermans-wharf-development-26d5204e9f7c">Fisherman’s Wharf apartment development</a>, she has committed to adding housing at the site, unlike Flynn.</p>
<p>Ramirez was also the only candidate to complete the <a class="reference external" href="http://vcyimby.org/endorsements">VC YIMBY questionnaire</a>.
Her pro-housing responses earned our endorsement:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>As Oxnard’s Mayor Pro Tem, Ramirez has consistently supported housing projects, accessory dwelling unit streamlining, and homelessness services, and has demonstrated intent to bring inclusive housing policy to the entire county. In our questionnaire, Ramirez said that farmworkers, disabled people, and seniors “are too often priced out and have to live in miserable and overcrowded conditions, which leads to the fraying of our society,” and that “we also need to support transportation options that will get people out of their cars and help to avoid the climate changes that are getting worse every day as people still drive gas powered vehicles.”</p>

<h3>Yes on Measure O<a class="headerlink" href="#yes-on-measure-o" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Measure O legalizes and taxes the cultivation, processing, distribution, and sale of cannabis.
This honestly shouldn’t even be necessary: California voted <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/01/us/legal-pot-california.html">by 14 points</a> to legalize recreational cannabis in 2016, and the law took effect on January 1, 2018.
But nearly three years later, many places have still banned it.
Measure O doesn’t go far enough–it still restricts locations and imposes onerously high taxes–
but it’s a step toward respecting the will of California voters,
that also raises <a class="reference external" href="https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/2020/09/01/study-ventura-county-2020-election-commercial-production-marijuana-initiative/3446372001/">$3 million</a> in annual tax revenue

<p>Becker is aiming to unseat incumbent Suza Francina.
Francina’s responses to the YIMBY questionnaire were generally pro-housing, for example expressing sadness that so many people who work in Ojai commute from other cities, and supporting fourplex legalization.
But she’s presided over <a class="reference external" href="https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/2019/11/25/ojai-new-apartments-built-first-time-10-years/4191477002/">extremely slow growth in Ojai</a> (where only 15 to 16 new homes are allowed to be built each year), and throughout her campaign has <a class="reference external" href="https://suzafrancinaforojaicitycouncil.com/f/a-second-opinion-response-to-my-opponent-on-affordable-housing">condemned</a> the sorts of large developments needed to address the housing crisis:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Developers benefit greatly from the affordable housing law when they build large developments and only a small percentage are actually affordable. Their developments take a ton of water and increase traffic, but don’t increase the sustainability, diversity, and resilience of the community in a meaningful way. Advocacy for 100% affordable developments, of small size, accomplishes more than a massive development where only 15% of the units are affordable and 85% are market rate.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Francina also <a class="reference external" href="https://suzafrancinaforojaicitycouncil.com/f/part-two-on-affordable-housing-draft">opposes short-term rentals</a>,
which provide extra income for homeowners and needed extra flexible housing supply—
for example, many of my grad school classmates from outside the US used Airbnb.
There’s no reason for short-term rentals to displace long-term residents if more housing is allowed to be built.</p>
<p>Becker, on the other hand, supports housing from all angles, as demonstrated both in her VC YIMBY questionnaire and in a phone call I had with her.</p>
<p>VC YIMBY <a class="reference external" href="https://www.vcyimby.org/endorsements#h.kc6jru5tgaf2">endorsed Becker</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Becker started off her questionnaire response by saying, “There is a housing crisis. I know, I see it daily…This crisis will not only affect every individual but also our City’s financial health, and the health of our businesses. Let’s make smart decisions that give Ojai a chance to continue to be livable and healthy.” From lobbying Sacramento to allow housing on church property, to proposing housing developments near transit, to advocating reduced fees on low-income housing, Becker has supported housing from many angles, and would bring that perspective to making Ojai more inclusive.</p>

All candidates emphasize similar issues: transparency, .
As no questionnaires have revealed major differences between the candidates, I am voting for the two most qualified candidates:
the incumbents.
Both Hall and Davis have doctorates in Education, have served on the OUHSD board since 2012, and have been administrators and leaders in local educational institutions for years or decades.
Amid a crisis like the pandemic, that kind of experience and stability will serve students well.</p>
<p>Hall has a M.S. in Statistics from San Diego State and a doctorate in Education from Pepperdine, has been a math teacher and administrator at Oxnard College, and was President of Ventura County Federation of College Teachers from 2010 to 2017.</p>
<p>Davis has a doctorate in Education from USC and has served OUHSD as superintendent and in other leadership roles over 40 years.</p>
<p>Botello has been an educator and administrator at Oxnard High School since 2015, and master’s degrees from UC Berkeley and UCLA in Journalism and Education, respectively.
She is also well-qualified, but I’m concerned about conflicts of interest from serving on the board while also working as an educator.</p>
<p>Garcia is a student at Cal Lutheran University.
She’s running a positive, student-powered campaign, but lacks the experience of other candidates to hit the ground running at a critical time for the district.</p>
<p>Crosby is an executive and business owner.
Despite his emphasis on transparency on his website, he did not respond to the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/2020/10/15/election-2020-ouhsd-gary-davis-steve-hall-elizabeth-botello-janessa-garcia/5975054002/">VC Star’s transparency questionnaire</a>.</p>

<a class="reference external" href="https://mikeforventura.com/issues/housing-crisis/">Mike Johnson</a>.
William Cornell is nominally running but doesn’t seem to have a serious campaign.</p>
<p>Gaston is the pro-housing option.
In his website, he demonstrated support for homeless shelters:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Ventura has taken a step in the right direction with ARCH, our new year-round shelter, and I would continue to support projects like this and others that address homelessness.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>And in the <a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/StaaHCKGxgk?t=366">Midtown Community Council forum</a>, Gaston’s leading statement focused on the housing crisis, calling for affordable homes, moderate homes, and executive homes.
In the forum he also supported infill projects to reduce traffic, supported density,and called for reducing the power of design review committee and historic preservation committee, which can often block projects.</p>
<p>Brown offers the starkest contrast to Gaston on housing.
In the forum, she didn’t include housing in her list of top three priorities.
She said of Ventura residents, “They don’t want large developments, don’t want three-, four-, five-, six- story developments.”
She was also the fiercest advocate for retaining the historic and design review committees, and she’s endorsed by Distrinct 2 NIMBY incumbent Christy Weir.</p>
<p>Johnson sits in between Brown and Gaston.
His website disparaged state housing bills like <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bbklaw.com/news-events/insights/2019/legal-alerts/10/sb-330-limits-local-laws-over-housing-developments">SB 330</a>,
but he also supported streamlining, fee reduction, and infill development.
In the candidate forum, his number-2 priority was “more housing, market rate and affordable,” and number-3 was homelessness.
He supported preserving the design review and historic preservation committees, but potentially reducing their power to block projects.
However, he’s endorsed by the NIMBY group Ventura Citizens for Hillside Preservation (which also endorsed Christy Weir).</p>
<p>Beyond his housing views, Gaston has experience in the technology field, which would bring new needed perspective on growing Ventura’s economy with new firms like the successful TheTradeDesk.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.pedersen4ventura.com">Pedersen</a> is running against <a class="reference external" href="https://joeschroederforcitycouncil.com/">Joe Schroeder</a>; other candidates Heather May Ellinger and Michael James Nolan do not appear to be running serious campaigns.</p>
<p>Pedersen’s website calls for “providing an appropriate level of desirable housing options.”</p>
<p>Schroeder’s website doesn’t mention housing, and he is endorsed by NIMBYs such as Christy Weir and Ventura Citizens for Hillside Preservation.</p>

<div><p>This four-year renewal of a $59 parcel tax would fund a range of academic programs. We’re especially fond of parcel taxes since they tax single family homes more than apartments (apartment complexes are treated as single parcels), making this a pro-housing way to help our children succeed.</p>
