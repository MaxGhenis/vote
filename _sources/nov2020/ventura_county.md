# Ventura County

See also [endorsements from Ventura County YIMBY](http://vcyimby.org/endorsements).
I was involved in that endorsement process, and mirror all those endorsements here,
including some of the language from our site and the [YIMBY Action text](https://yimbyaction.org/endorsements/ventura-county/).

## Countywide or cross-city offices

### Julia Brownley for CA-26 House district

She's the Democrat.

### Jacqui Irwin for Assembly District 44

She's the Democrat.

### Monique Limon for Senate District 19

She's the Democrat.

### Carmen Ramirez for District 5 Supervisor

Oxnard Mayor Pro Tem [Carmen Ramirez](https://carmen4supervisor.com/) and 
Oxnard Mayor [Tim Flynn](https://www.tim4supervisor.com/) are running for the county supervisor seat
vacated by John Zaragoza, who's termed out and running for Oxnard Mayor ([I'm voting for him](nov2020-oxnard-mayor)).
Ramirez is simply the more pro-housing choice.
She [advocated forcefully](https://twitter.com/MaxGhenis/status/1197031504490057729) for a homeless shelter.
She supported compliance with a state accessory dwelling unit law, which Flynn wrongly claimed would 
[worsen overcrowding](https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/local/2020/07/23/oxnard-housing-real-estate-application-granny-flat-construction/5486652002/) (it would do the opposite).
While both Ramirez and Flynn voted against the [Fisherman's Wharf apartment development](https://medium.com/vcyimby/support-for-oxnard-fishermans-wharf-development-26d5204e9f7c), she has committed to adding housing at the site, unlike Flynn.

Ramirez was also the only candidate to complete the [VC YIMBY questionnaire](http://vcyimby.org/endorsements).
Her pro-housing responses earned our endorsement:

>As Oxnard’s Mayor Pro Tem, Ramirez has consistently supported housing projects, accessory dwelling unit streamlining, and homelessness services, and has demonstrated intent to bring inclusive housing policy to the entire county. In our questionnaire, Ramirez said that farmworkers, disabled people, and seniors “are too often priced out and have to live in miserable and overcrowded conditions, which leads to the fraying of our society,” and that “we also need to support transportation options that will get people out of their cars and help to avoid the climate changes that are getting worse every day as people still drive gas powered vehicles.”


### Joe Ramirez for Community College Board Area 3

[Stan Mantooth](http://stanmantooth.com), Ventura County Superintendent of Schools
[Nicole Wall](https://nicole-wall.net/), retired teacher "Restorative Justice Practices in Schools Facilitator and immediately began implementing a program for Social and Educational Justice"
[Joe Ramirez](https://www.ramirez4trustee3.com/), retired college administrator

### Yes on Measure O

Measure O legalizes and taxes the cultivation, processing, distribution, and sale of cannabis.


## Oxnard

(nov2020-oxnard-mayor)
### John Zaragoza for Oxnard Mayor



Running against Richard Linares (inactive) and Deirdre Frank (chair of the planning commission).

### Steve Hall and Gary Davis for Oxnard Union High School District Board

Incumbents [Steve Hall](https://www.electstevehall.com/) and 
[Gary Davis](https://garydavis4ouhsd.com/) are fighting for re-election,
with [Elizabeth Botello](https://botelloforouhsd.com/),
[Geoffrey Crosby](https://electcrosby.com/the-issues),
and [Janessa Garcia](https://garciaforouhsd.com/about-us) vying for one of the two open spots.
All candidates emphasize similar issues: transparency, .
As no questionnaires have revealed major differences between the candidates, I am voting for the two most qualified candidates:
the incumbents.
Both Hall and Davis have doctorates in Education, have served on the OUHSD board since 2012, and have been administrators and leaders in local educational institutions for years or decades.
Amid a crisis like the pandemic, that kind of experience and stability will serve students well.

Hall has a M.S. in Statistics from San Diego State and a doctorate in Education from Pepperdine, has been a math teacher and administrator at Oxnard College, and was President of Ventura County Federation of College Teachers from 2010 to 2017.

Davis has a doctorate in Education from USC and has served OUHSD as superintendent and in other leadership roles over 40 years.

Botello has been an educator and administrator at Oxnard High School since 2015, and master's degrees from UC Berkeley and UCLA in Journalism and Education, respectively.
She is also well-qualified, but I'm concerned about conflicts of interest from serving on the board while also working as an educator.

Garcia is a student at Cal Lutheran University.
She's running a positive, student-powered campaign, but lacks the experience of other candidates to hit the ground running at a critical time for the district.

Crosby is an executive and business owner.
Despite his emphasis on transparency on his website, he did not respond to the [VC Star's transparency questionnaire](https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/2020/10/15/election-2020-ouhsd-gary-davis-steve-hall-elizabeth-botello-janessa-garcia/5975054002/).


### James Aragon for Oxnard Treasurer

[James Aragon](https://www.facebook.com/Aragon4Treasurer/), a contract analyst, is running against incumbent
[Phillip Molina](https://www.facebook.com/Phillip-S-Molina-for-Oxnard-Treasurer-171608386581718).
A [VC Star questionnaire](https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/2020/09/21/incumbent-oxnard-city-treasurer-phil-molina-has-one-challenger-november/5736579002/?fbclid=IwAR0BYtq93ZwQpVXtJps4euLSM1n5Gbhwg98clcLiPO8tXrYnND1NzNK1FNc) and
[League of Women Voters forum](https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/2020/10/14/election-2020-phil-molina-james-aragon-oxnard-city-treasurer-candidates/5964358002/?fbclid=IwAR3R3s6jlCLpLfU94EDt83KLvBmAlNj14FL_6rXRlp58Ph_vKbKVs8WBoIw) failed to reveal substantial policy
differences between the candidates---if anything, they seem to credit each other with having similar views.
Both are nominally qualified, with MBAs and finance experience.
On a political level, neither is appealing: Aragon is voting for Republican Aaron Starr for City Council,
and one of Molina's few posts on his campaign site is from an "All Lives Matter" protest.

Instead, I'm voting primarily on the relationship with City Hall.
Molina was elected in 2016, and City Council took away some of his job responsibilities after an investigator
identified malfeasance, spurring [Measure L](nov2020-oxnard-l) which would restore these duties.
Both candidates support L (I'm voting against it).
A new treasurer would ease this toxicity.

### Jess Ramirez and Celina Zacarias for Harbor District 1 Commissioner

[Jess Ramirez](https://www.jessramirez2020.com) and
[Celina Zacarias](https://www.votecelina.com) are the incumbents, and only apparently serious candidates.
Challengers O'Leary, a [retired educator](https://www.oxnardsd.org/Page/13059) and former Oxnard School District Trustee, and 
Fraser, the [former president and CEO](http://www.smartvoter.org/2012/11/06/ca/vn/vote/fraser_a/bio.html) of the Port Hueneme Chamber of Commerce, have neither a website nor Facebook page.
