# Voter guide

Welcome to my voter guide!
You can see my latest at the November 2020 page, and previous voter guides on [Medium](https://medium.com/@MaxGhenis/november-2018-voter-guide-3f534e6ed54d).

*These recommendations are my own, and do not reflect positions of organizations I'm associated with.*
